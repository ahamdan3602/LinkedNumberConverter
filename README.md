# LinkedNumberConverter
Converts a set of numbers from one number system to another.
This repository contains Java code for a Linked Number Converter, designed to manipulate numbers represented as linked lists in different numerical bases. The main class, LinkedNumber, provides functionalities to create, manipulate, and convert numbers represented as linked lists. It includes methods to create a linked number from either a string or an integer, check if the number is valid, retrieve the base, get the number of digits, convert between numerical bases, add and remove digits at specific positions, and compare numbers for equality.

The LinkedNumber class utilizes a doubly linked list (DLL) structure to represent numbers, with each digit stored in a Digit object. The code supports conversions between decimal and non-decimal number systems, including hexadecimal, octal, and binary, providing flexibility for various numerical computations.

Additionally, the repository includes a custom exception class, LinkedNumberException, to handle errors related to invalid number representations.

This Linked Number Converter serves as a versatile tool for numerical manipulation and conversion, offering a practical implementation for applications requiring flexible numerical base conversions and arithmetic operations.
